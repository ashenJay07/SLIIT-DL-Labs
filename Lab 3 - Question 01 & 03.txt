Question 1: Based on the result, explain how 1D convolution can be used to identify the edges in an image

Answer:
	1D convolution with the filter [-1, 1] identifies edges by detecting intensity changes. Negative values 
	capture intensity decreases, and positive values capture increases, producing peaks at edge positions. 
	This technique applies similarly to images: convert to 1D, convolve with an edge-sensitive filter, and 
	find peaks to locate edges.





Question 3: 

Why does the validation error increases when the number of epochs are increased? 
	- the model is overfitting

Explain how you can modify the training process to stop that from happening.
	- Early stopping: stop the model training once it noticed an increase of the validation error
	- Regularization: Add regularization technique such as L1 or L2
	- Drop out: switch off some links randomly 
	- Use more training data if possible
	
Explain how the mini batch SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) algorithm can converge faster than the batch Gradient Descent algorithm.
	Batch Gradient Descent 
	Considering the whole data set in each step. 
	The whole data set is iterating in each step. This consumes a huge time.

	Mini batch SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)
	Takes a batch of data set which is less that the actual data set at a time and update the parameters. 
	Instead of waiting for the model to compute whole data set, able to update the parameters more frequently. As it proceeding as batchesthis is fater than Batch Grdaient Descent
